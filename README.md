# 🧠 Kit

This repository contains my complete Data Structures & Algorithms learning journey including **320+ solved problems**, handwritten notes, patterns, and summaries.  
It has now been updated to include mostly asked questions of `SQL` and `JavaScript ( specifically for MERN tech stack roles )`.

> 🎯 **Purpose:** Build a strong foundation for **coding interviews, competitive programming, and placement preparation**.
