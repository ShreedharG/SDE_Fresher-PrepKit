# 🧠 DSA Boss Notes

This repository contains my complete Data Structures & Algorithms learning journey — including **300+ solved problems**, handwritten notes, patterns, and summaries.

The purpose of this repo is to build a strong foundation for **coding interviews, competitive programming, and placement preparation.**
